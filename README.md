# Vehicle-Backward-Modeling

[Vehicle_Model.slx](https://github.com/samerwh/Vehicle-Backward-Modeling/blob/main/VehicleModel.slx) is a Simulink model of a conventional gasoline vehicle based on the European Common Artemis Driving Cycles: Urban, Rural Road, and Motorway. The simulation includes vehicle dynamics, transmission, and engine models to assess the fuel consumption based on the velocity profiles of each driving cycle.
